# Video Uploader and Sharing Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to upload video files and share the generated links with others. It consists of two main components: a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Users can upload video files (supported formats) either by dragging and dropping them or by selecting from their device.

- **Progress Tracking:** The application displays an upload progress bar, indicating the percentage of completion during the file upload.

- **Video Link Sharing:** After a successful upload, users are provided with a direct link to their uploaded video, making it easy to share with others.

- **Share Buttons:** Users can quickly share the video link on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI, react-share

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Multer
